SurrealDB is designed to be simple to install and simple to run - using just one command from your terminal. In addition to traditional installation, SurrealDB can be installed and run with HomeBrew, Docker, or using any other container orchestration tool such as Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, Rancher, or in Kubernetes. Visit the [SurrealDB install page](https://surrealdb.com/install) for more information.

This repository houses the install script located at [deb.surrealdb.com](https://deb.surrealdb.com). It installs the SurrealDB command-line tools and database server, automatically detecting the host operating platform, cpu architecture type - then downloads the latest binary and installs a `systemd` service configuration file for the Debian-based operating system.

If you prefer not using a package manager or Docker, then the easiest and preferred way to get going with SurrealDB is to run one of the following commands in your terminal.

#### Install on Debian

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://deb.surrealdb.com | sh
```

#### Install on Ubuntu

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://deb.surrealdb.com | sh
```
